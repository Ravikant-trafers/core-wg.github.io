## CoRE Working Group

The Constrained Restful Environments Working Group (CoREWG) is an [IETF](https://ietf.org/) working that provides a framework for resource-oriented applications intended to
run on constrained IP networks. This includes applications to monitor simple
sensors (e.g. temperature sensors, light switches, and power meters), to
control actuators (e.g. light switches, heating controllers, and door
locks), and to manage devices.

The group will coordinate on requirements from many
organizations and SDOs. The working group will closely coordinate with
other IETF working groups, particularly of the constrained node networks
cluster (6Lo, 6TiSCH, LWIG, ROLL, ACE, COSE), and appropriate
groups in the IETF OPS and Security areas. Work on these subjects, as
well as on interaction models and design patterns may benefit from close
cooperation with the [Thing-to-Thing Research Group](http://t2trg.github.io/).

More information about the working group is available at the [IETF CoRE group page](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/core/).
